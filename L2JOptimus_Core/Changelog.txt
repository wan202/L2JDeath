--------------------------------------------
                 aCis 368 
--------------------------------------------
Chamberlain Manor's Certificates
   - Implement a missing castle chamberlain feature, the possibility to buy Manor's Certificates. HTMs and behavior is OFF-like.
   - Added "//reset_certificates castleName" admincommand. Integrate it on the castle panel (had to reorganize it a little).

Cleanup Config
   - Drop DATABASE_MAX_IDLE_TIME time (set to 0 by default).
   - Re-order login/server .properties
   - Drop ACCEPT_ALTERNATE_ID / REQUEST_ID from login on Config.java (weren't existing on .properties, not used by login)
   
Login
   - Drop external/internal hostnames system ; only one hostname is allowed.
   - LoginServerThread cleanup :
      - Drop _waitingClients (synchronized, check logic already handled by the other CHMap).
      - Drop some variables (7 were calling Config), some unused methods. Some rename are made.
      - Move some of the security check logic here and there to make it cleaner.
   - ServerStatus content is reorganized in both LS and GS sides. Addition of age limit / pvp server tags.
   - FloodProtectedListener connections are registered on a ConcurrentHashMap.
   - Creation of ServerData class (was part of ServerList packet). Cleanup of ServerList for easier proxy handler implementation.
   - Creation of GameServerInfo class (was part of GameServerTable).

MMOCore
   - Avoid to crash on packet read buffer underflow (client connection is dropped instead).
   - Tweak MMOCore values to process packets x4 faster (5k packets = from 16s to 4s).
   - Tweak CLIENT_PACKET_QUEUE_MAX_PACKETS_PER_SECOND && CLIENT_PACKET_QUEUE_MAX_AVERAGE_PACKETS_PER_SECOND default values (x2 now).
   
Instance rename && reorganization part II
   - L2Object is renamed WorldObject.
   - Character (previously L2Character) is renamed Creature due to class already defined on JDK (and making imports complicated).
   - AI models are renamed to fit with new naming convention (PlayerAI, PlayableAI, CreatureAI, etc).
   - The package gameserver.ai is now moved on gameserver.model.actor.ai (best location). ai.model is renamed ai.type (because gameserver.model.actor.ai.model was redundant).
   - Templates, Stat && Status models are renamed to fit with new naming convention.

Logging rework
   - log.cfg is renamed logging.properties.
   - Drop 'audit' layer && associated IllegalPlayerAction system (all punishements are deleted, DefaultPunish && DefaultPunishParam configs are dropped). Reason : that's the point you write integrity checks.
   - Drop GMAudit, uses the default formatter/handler/filter (all GMs are written on the same file).
   - Whole logging system is moved into commons. Create 'filter', 'formatter' && 'handler' packages on log. Rename package 'log' to 'logging'.
   - All handlers got a limit and a count to avoid to flood server with logs. The log limit is set to 1mo instead of 500ko. The count is setted to 5 files.
   - All logs are now moved in their own folders (those folders are created by default).
   - Logs name pattern has been edited (typeName_count.txt), the extension is now .txt.
   - All formatters are based on same writting style.
   
Misc
   - Merge math methods from Util with MathUtil. Delete Util.
   - banned_ip.cfg is renamed banned_ips.properties.
   - FloodProtectors class is moved from gameserver.util to gameserver.network.
   - Addition of SysUtil, holding system related methods.
   - L2Bookmark > Bookmark + basic cleanup of BookmarkTable.
   - Minor cleanup of GameServer and L2LoginServer (don't keep references when not needed, drop of "L2" > LoginServer).
   - MinionList cleanup, replace the CopyOnWriteArrayList (poor performance).
   - Minor cleanup of RaidBoss (drop a double isMovementDisabled() check).
   - Fix a typo error on query prior to sieges rework, ty HaddWik for report. Minor Siege class cleanup.
   - SevenSigns minor cleanup (drop 3 redundant static variables and one method).
   - Slight cleanup of RecipeShopSellList packet (avoid .get on a for loop).
   - villagemaster/30594.htm edit.
   
PS: if you got better log writting style, I would eventually integrate it.
PS2: build.xml is edited, some .properties are edited.
