I have no more to say to you. Please tell the Dwarf what I said.<br1>
There is no more danger here; you have resolved all of the problems.<br1>
I am being operated by a Starstone, but once that Starstone disappears, I will begin to be deactivated. I am looking forward to it Â— I want to rest, at long last.<br1>
Please take this. It is all I have left to give.
