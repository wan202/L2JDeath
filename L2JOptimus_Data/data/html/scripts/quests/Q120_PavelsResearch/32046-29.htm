Oh, little one! You've done it!<br1>
The crisis in the north wing has been averted!<br1>
But I"m afraid we still have some serious problems in the east and west wings!<br1>
Go to the east wing... it's the administration wing... You must find out...<br1>
Speak with Wendy, little one!<br1>
Find out what's going on in the east wing...<br1>
She's bound to know...<br1>
My wonderful Wendy...<br1>
awoke there...<br1>
She should know the password!
