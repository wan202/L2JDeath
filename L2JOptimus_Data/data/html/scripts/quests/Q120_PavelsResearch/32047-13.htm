All I know is that Dr. Chaos operated some kind of device.<br1>
According to my memory, the device was meant to control the weather around Pavel.<br1>
When the sleeping system awoke, its first act was to activate this device.<br1>
I think perhaps the last mode in which it operated was N-45: Arrival of Eternal Spring.<br>
