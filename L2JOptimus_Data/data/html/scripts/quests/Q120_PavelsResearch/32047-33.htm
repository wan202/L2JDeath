Please tell the Dwarf what I said.<br1>
The danger here is past; you have resolved all of the problems.<br1>
I am being operated by a Starstone, but once that Starstone disappears, I will begin to be deactivated.<br1>
That process will take some time, but I am looking forward to it. I want to rest.
