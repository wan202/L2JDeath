<center>A message from Atlanta</center><br>
My little friend... I thank you for your help. Thanks to you, I am now able to join my friends in a time and place far away, finally freed from my worries.<br1>
When I look back, it all seems so strange... the great Spire of Arbiterre, the life-changing Mimir's Elixir, the sky-changing study of Pavel...<br1>
I learned many things from you, my little friend, about the present times and the true strength and the wisdom of a leader.<br1>
Most important of all, you taught me that the Age of the Giants has truly passed. The skills of the Giants are no longer needed in these times.<br>
